  <h1><a name="Thread Safety">Thread Safety</a></h1>
  <hr>

  <p>The C++ Standard says nothing about multithreaded environments; nevertheless most nontrivial operating
  systems support some form of threading. (See the <b><a href="index_thr.html">Dinkum Threads Library</a></b>
  for a portable to way to control multiple threads from a C or C++ program.) In such an environment, it is
  important to know what operations are safe on data that is shared between two or more threads, what
  operations are unsafe, and what you can do to make unsafe operations safe.</p>

  <p>The Dinkum Compleat Libraries can be built either as multithreaded or single-threaded. The former is, of
  course, the most robust; but the latter can be smaller and faster in an environment where thread safety is
  never an issue, because all threading code is omitted. The setup scripts that select the active library,
  and optionally build it, have the options <b><code>MT</code></b>, to select a multithreaded library, and
  <b><code>NO_MT</code></b>, to select a single-threaded library. Multithreaded is the usual default.</p>

  <p>The following descriptions apply only to multithreaded libraries.</p>

  <h2>Standard C Input/Output</h2>

  <p>In the Standard C Library, all input/output is mediated by objects of type <code><b><a href=
  "stdio.html#FILE">FILE</a></b></code>. Atomic operations on these objects, such as calls to <code><a href=
  "stdio.html#getc">getc</a></code> and <code><a href="stdio.html#putc">putc</a></code>, are protected
  against simultaneous access from different threads. Thus, you can safely share <code>FILE</code> objects
  across threads without worrying about loss of integrity. But you might not like the way file accesses
  interleave, so you typically need additional thread locks at the appropriate level of granularity.</p>

  <p>If you want changes to the file to be reflected after each atomic write, you must change the definition
  of the macro <code><b>_FILE_OP_LOCKS</b></code> from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> in all copies of the
  internal header <code>&lt;yvals.h&gt;</code>, then rebuild the libraries. Since this disables quite a bit
  of file buffering, your program may well run slower. And you might still not like the way the atomic writes
  interleave; but you do have tighter control over file modifications with this option.</p>

  <h2>Standard C++ Input/Output</h2>

  <p>In the Standard C++ Library, all input/output is mediated by <b><a name="iostream object">iosrteam
  objects</a></b> of template types <code><a href="istream.html#basic_istream">basic_istream</a></code>,
  <code><a href="istream.html#basic_iostream">basic_iostream</a></code>, and <code><a href=
  "ostream.html#basic_ostream">basic_ostream</a></code>. Atomic operations on these objects, such as
  extractions and insertions, are protected against simultaneous access from different threads. They are also
  synchronized with operations directly on the <code>FILE</code> object that underlies each iostream object.
  (In this <a href="index.html#implementation">implementation</a> there is no need to call the iostream
  member function <code><a href="ios.html#ios_base::sync_with_stdio">sync_with_stdio</a></code> to ensure
  such synchronization, nor is there any performance benefit in disabling it.) Thus, you can safely share
  iostream objects across threads without worrying about loss of integrity. But once again you might not like
  the way file accesses interleave, so you typically need additional thread locks at the appropriate level of
  granularity.</p>

  <p>If you want changes to the file to be reflected after each atomic write, you must change the definition
  of the macro <code><b>_IOSTREAM_OP_LOCKS</b></code> from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> in all copies of
  the internal header <code>&lt;yvals.h&gt;</code>, then rebuild the libraries. Since this disables quite a
  bit of file buffering, your program may well run slower. And you might still not like the way the atomic
  writes interleave; but you do have tighter control over file modifications with this option.</p>

  <h2>Containers</h2>

  <p>For the <b><a name="container objects">container objects</a></b> defined in the Standard C++ Library,
  such as <b><a href="lib_cont.html">STL Containers</a></b> and objects of template class <code><a href=
  "string2.html#basic_string">basic_string</a></code>, this <a href=
  "index.html#implementation">implementation</a> follows the widely adopted practices spelled out for
  <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html">SGI STL</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Multiple threads can safely read the same container object. (There are no unprotected mutable
    subobjects within a container object.)</li>

    <li>Two threads can safely manipulate different container objects of the same type. (There are no
    unprotected shared static objects within a container type.)</li>

    <li>You must protect against simultaneous access to a container object if at least one thread is
    modifying the object. (The obvious synchronization primitives, such as those in the Dinkum Threads
    Library, will not be subverted by the container object.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thus, no attempt is made to ensure that atomic operations on container objects are thread safe; but it
  is easy enough to make shared container objects that are thread safe at the appropriate level of
  granularity.</p>
