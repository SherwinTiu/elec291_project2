  <p>The <a href="index.html#Standard%20Template%20Library">Standard Template Library</a>, or <a href=
  "index.html#STL">STL</a>, establishes uniform standards for the application of <a href=
  "#Iterator%20Conventions">iterators</a> to STL <a href="lib_cont.html#Containers">containers</a> or other
  sequences that you define, by STL <a href="#Algorithm%20Conventions">algorithms</a> or other functions that
  you define. This document summarizes many of the conventions used widely throughout the Standard Template
  Library.</p>

  <h2><a name="Iterator Conventions">Iterator Conventions</a></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>The STL facilities make widespread use of <b><a name="iterators">iterators</a></b>, to mediate between
  the various algorithms and the sequences upon which they act. For brevity in the remainder of this
  document, the name of an iterator type (or its prefix) indicates the category of iterators required for
  that type. In order of increasing power, the categories are summarized here as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><code><a name="OutIt">OutIt</a></code></b> -- An <b><a name="output iterator">output
    iterator</a></b> <code>X</code> can only have a value <code>V</code> stored indirect on it, after which
    it <i>must</i> be incremented before the next store, as in <code>(*X++ = V)</code>, <code>(*X = V,
    ++X)</code>, or <code>(*X = V, X++)</code>.</li>

    <li><b><code><a name="InIt">InIt</a></code></b> -- An <b><a name="input iterator">input iterator</a></b>
    <code>X</code> can represent a singular value that indicates end-of-sequence. If an input iterator does
    not compare equal to its end-of-sequence value, it can have a value <code>V</code> accessed indirect on
    it any number of times, as in <code>(V = *X)</code>. To progress to the next value, or end-of-sequence,
    you increment it, as in <code>++X</code>, <code>X++</code>, or <code>(V = *X++)</code>. Once you
    increment <i>any</i> copy of an input iterator, none of the other copies can safely be compared,
    dereferenced, or incremented thereafter.</li>

    <li><b><code><a name="FwdIt">FwdIt</a></code></b> -- A <b><a name="forwarditerator">forward
    iterator</a></b> <code>X</code> can take the place of an output iterator (for writing) or an input
    iterator (for reading). You can, however, read (via <code>V = *X</code>) what you just wrote (via
    <code>*X = V</code>) through a forward iterator. And you can make multiple copies of a forward iterator,
    each of which can be dereferenced and incremented independently.</li>

    <li><b><code><a name="BidIt">BidIt</a></code></b> -- A <b><a name="bidirectional iterator">bidirectional
    iterator</a></b> <code>X</code> can take the place of a forward iterator. You can, however, also
    decrement a bidirectional iterator, as in <code>--X</code>, <code>X--</code>, or <code>(V =
    *X--)</code>.</li>

    <li><b><code><a name="RanIt">RanIt</a></code></b> -- A <b><a name="random-access iterator">random-access
    iterator</a></b> <code>X</code> can take the place of a bidirectional iterator. You can also perform much
    the same integer arithmetic on a random-access iterator that you can on an object pointer. For
    <code>N</code> an integer object, you can write <code>x[N]</code>, <code>x + N</code>, <code>x -
    N</code>, and <code>N + X</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that an object pointer can take the place of a random-access iterator, or any other for that
  matter. All iterators can be assigned or copied. They are assumed to be lightweight objects and hence are
  often passed and returned by value, not by reference. Note also that none of the operations described above
  can throw an exception, at least when performed on a valid iterator.</p>

  <p>The hierarchy of iterator categories can be summarize by showing three sequences. For write-only access
  to a sequence, you can use any of:</p>
  <pre>
output iterator
    -&gt; forward iterator
    -&gt; bidirectional iterator
    -&gt; random-access iterator
</pre>

  <p>The right arrow means ``can be replaced by.'' So any algorithm that calls for an output iterator should
  work nicely with a forward iterator, for example, but <i>not</i> the other way around.</p>

  <p>For read-only access to a sequence, you can use any of:</p>
  <pre>
input iterator
    -&gt; forward iterator
    -&gt; bidirectional iterator
    -&gt; random-access iterator
</pre>

  <p>An input iterator is the weakest of all categories, in this case.</p>

  <p>Finally, for read/write access to a sequence, you can use any of:</p>
  <pre>
forward iterator
    -&gt; bidirectional iterator
    -&gt; random-access iterator
</pre>

  <p>Remember that an object pointer can always serve as a random-access iterator. Hence, it can serve as any
  category of iterator, so long as it supports the proper read/write access to the sequence it
  designates.</p>

  <p>An iterator <code>It</code> other than an object pointer must also define the member types required by
  the specialization <code><a href="iterator.html#iterator_traits">iterator_traits</a>&lt;It&gt;</code>. Note
  that these requirements can be met by deriving <code>It</code> from the public base class <code><a href=
  "iterator.html#iterator">iterator</a></code>.</p>

  <p>This ``algebra'' of iterators is fundamental to practically everything else in the <a href=
  "index.html#Standard%20Template%20Library">Standard Template Library</a>. It is important to understand the
  promises, and limitations, of each iterator category to see how iterators are used by containers and
  algorithms in STL.</p>

  <h2><a name="Algorithm Conventions">Algorithm Conventions</a></h2>
  <hr>

  <p>The descriptions of the algorithm template functions employ several shorthand phrases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The phrase ``<b>in the range <code>[A, B)</code></b>'' means the sequence of zero or more discrete
    values beginning with <code>A</code> up to but not including <code>B</code>. A range is valid only if
    <code>B</code> is <b>reachable</b> from <code>A</code> -- you can store <code>A</code> in an object
    <code>N</code> (<code>N = A</code>), increment the object zero or more times (<code>++N</code>), and have
    the object compare equal to <code>B</code> after a finite number of increments (<code>N ==
    B</code>).</li>

    <li>The phrase ``<b>each <code>N</code> in the range <code>[A, B)</code></b>'' means that <code>N</code>
    begins with the value <code>A</code> and is incremented zero or more times until it equals the value
    <code>B</code>. The case <code>N == B</code> is <i>not</i> in the range.</li>

    <li>The phrase ``<b>the lowest value of <code>N</code> in the range <code>[A, B)</code> such that X</b>''
    means that the condition X is determined for each <code>N</code> in the range <code>[A, B)</code> until
    the condition X is met.</li>

    <li>The phrase ``<b>the highest value of <code>N</code> in the range <code>[A, B)</code> such that
    X</b>'' usually means that X is determined for each <code>N</code> in the range <code>[A, B)</code>. The
    function stores in <code>K</code> a copy of <code>N</code> each time the condition X is met. If any such
    store occurs, the function replaces the final value of <code>N</code> (which equals <code>B</code>) with
    the value of <code>K</code>. For a bidirectional or random-access iterator, however, it can also mean
    that <code>N</code> begins with the highest value in the range and is decremented over the range until
    the condition X is met.</li>

    <li>Expressions such as <b><code>X - Y</code></b>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> can be
    iterators other than random-access iterators, are intended in the mathematical sense. The function does
    not necessarily evaluate <code>operator-</code> if it must determine such a value. The same is also true
    for expressions such as <b><code>X + N</code></b> and <b><code>X - N</code></b>, where <code>N</code> is
    an integer type.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Several algorithms make use of a predicate that performs a <b><a name="pairwise comparison">pairwise
  comparison</a></b>, such as with <code>operator==</code>, to yield a <code>bool</code> result. The
  predicate function <code>operator==</code>, or any replacement for it, must not alter either of its
  operands. It must yield the same <code>bool</code>result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the
  same result if a copy of either operand is substituted for the operand.</p>

  <p>Several algorithms make use of a predicate that must impose a <b><a name="strict weak ordering">strict
  weak ordering</a></b> on pairs of elements from a sequence. For the predicate <code>pr(X, Y)</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>pr(X, X)</code> is false (X can't be ordered before itself)</li>

    <li><code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> have an <b><a name="equivalent ordering">equivalent
    ordering</a></b> if <code>!pr(X, Y) &amp;&amp; !pr(Y, X)</code> (<code>X == Y</code> need not be
    defined)</li>

    <li><code>pr(X, Y) &amp;&amp; pr(Y, Z)</code> implies <code>pr(X, Z)</code> (ordering is transitive)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of these algorithms implicitly use the predicate <code>X &lt; Y</code>, and some use a predicate
  <code>pr(X, Y)</code> passed as a function object. Predicates that satisfy the ``strict weak ordering''
  requirement are <code>X &lt; Y</code> and <code>X &gt; Y</code> for the arithmetic types and for string
  objects. Note, however, that predicates such as <code>X &lt;= Y</code> and <code>X &gt;= Y</code> for these
  same types do <i>not</i> satisfy this requirement.</p>

  <p>A sequence of elements designated by iterators in the range <code>[first, last)</code> is ``<b>a
  sequence <a name="sequence partitioning">partitioned by</a> <code>operator&lt;</code></b>'' if, for each
  <code>N</code> in the range <code>[0, last - first)</code> and for each <code>M</code> in the range
  <code>(N, last - first)</code> the predicate <code>!(*(first + M) &lt; *(first + N))</code> is true. (Note
  that the elements are sorted in <i>ascending</i> order.) The predicate function <code>operator&lt;</code>,
  or any replacement for it, must not alter either of its operands. It must yield the same
  <code>bool</code>result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the same result if a copy of either
  operand is substituted for the operand.</p>

  <p>A sequence of elements designated by iterators in the range <code>[first, last)</code> is ``<b>a
  sequence <a name="sequence ordering">ordered by</a> <code>operator&lt;</code></b>'' if it is partitioned by
  that predicate function and, furthermore, the predicate function imposes a <a href=
  "#strict%20weak%20ordering">strict weak ordering</a> on the operands it compares.</p>

  <p>A sequence of elements designated by iterators in the range <code>[first, last)</code> is ``<b>a
  <a name="heap ordering">heap ordered</a> by <code>operator&lt;</code></b>'' if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For each <code>N</code> in the range <code>[1, last - first)</code> the predicate <code>!(*first &lt;
    *(first + N))</code> is true. (The first element is the largest.)</li>

    <li>It is possible to insert (<code>push_heap</code>) a new element or remove (<code>pop_heap</code>) the
    largest element in logarithmic time and preserve the heap discipline in the resulting sequence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Its internal structure is otherwise known only to the template functions <code><a href=
  "algorith.html#make_heap">make_heap</a></code>, <code><a href="algorith.html#pop_heap">pop_heap</a></code>,
  and <code><a href="algorith.html#push_heap">push_heap</a></code>. As with an <a href=
  "#sequence%20ordering">ordered sequence</a>, the predicate function <code>operator&lt;</code>, or any
  replacement for it, must not alter either of its operands, and it must impose a <a href=
  "#strict%20weak%20ordering">strict weak ordering</a> on the operands it compares. It must yield the same
  <code>bool</code>result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the same result if a copy of either
  operand is substituted for the operand.</p>
