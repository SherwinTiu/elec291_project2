  <h1><a name="Expressions">Expressions</a></h1>
  <hr>

  <p>You write expressions to determine values, to alter values stored in objects, and to call functions that
  perform input and output. In fact, you express all computations in the program by writing expressions. The
  translator must evaluate some of the expressions you write to determine properties of the program. The
  translator or the target environment must evaluate other expressions prior to program startup to determine
  the initial values stored in objects with static duration. The program evaluates the remaining expressions
  when it executes.</p>

  <p>This document describes briefly just those aspect of expressions most relevant to the use of the
  Standard C library:</p>

  <p>An <b><a name="address constant expression">address constant expression</a></b> specifies a value that
  has a pointer type and that the translator or target environment can determine prior to program
  startup.</p>

  <p>A <b><a name="constant expression">constant expression</a></b> specifies a value that the translator or
  target environment can determine prior to program startup.</p>

  <p>An <b><a name="integer constant expression">integer constant expression</a></b> specifies a value that
  has an integer type and that the translator can determine at the point in the program where you write the
  expression. (You cannot write a function call, assigning operator, or <i>comma</i> operator except as part
  of the operand of a <i><a href="#sizeof%20operator">sizeof</a></i> operator.) In addition, you must write
  only subexpressions that have integer type. You can, however, write a floating-point constant expression as
  the operand of an integer <i>type cast</i> operator.</p>

  <p>A <b><a name="floating-point constant expression">floating-point constant expression</a></b> specifies a
  value that has a floating-point type and that the translator can determine at the point in the program
  where you write the expression. (You cannot write a function call, assigning operator, or <i>comma</i>
  operator except as part of the operand of a <i><a href="#sizeof%20operator">sizeof</a></i> operator.) In
  addition, you must write only subexpressions that have integer or floating-point type.</p>

  <p>An <b><a name="lvalue expression">lvalue expression</a></b> An lvalue expression designates an object
  that has an object type other than an array type. Hence, you can access the value stored in the object. A
  <i>modifiable</i> lvalue expression designates an object that has an object type other than an array type
  or a <i>const</i> type. Hence, you can alter the value stored in the object. You can also designate objects
  with an lvalue expression that has an array type or an incomplete type, but you can only take the address
  of such an expression.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Promoting">Promoting</a></b> occurs for an expression whose integer type is not one of the
  ``computational'' types. Except when it is the operand of the <i><a href=
  "#sizeof%20operator">sizeof</a></i> operator, an integer <a href="#rvalue%20expression">rvalue
  expression</a> has one of four types: <i>int, unsigned int, long,</i> or <i>unsigned long.</i> When you
  write an expression in an rvalue context and the expression has an integer type that is not one of these
  types, the translator <i>promotes</i> its type to one of these. If all of the values representable in the
  original type are also representable as type <i>int,</i> then the promoted type is <i>int.</i> Otherwise,
  the promoted type is <i>unsigned int.</i> Thus, for <i>signed char, short,</i> and any <i>signed
  bitfield</i> type, the promoted type is <i>int.</i> For each of the remaining integer types (<i>char,
  unsigned char, unsigned short,</i> any plain <i>bitfield</i> type, or any <i>unsigned bitfield</i> type),
  the effect of these rules is to favor promoting to <i>int</i> wherever possible, but to promote to
  <i>unsigned int</i> if necessary to preserve the original value in all possible cases.</p>

  <p>An <b><a name="rvalue expression">rvalue expression</a></b> is an expression whose value can be
  determined only when the program executes. The term also applies to expressions which <i>need not</i> be
  determined until program execution.</p>

  <p>You use the <b><a name="sizeof operator">sizeof</a></b> operator, as in the expression <code>sizeof
  X</code> to determine the size in bytes of an object whose type is the type of <code>X</code>. The
  translator uses the expression you write for <code>X</code> only to determine a type; it is not
  evaluated.</p>

  <p>A <b><a name="void expression">void expression</a></b> has type <i>void.</i></p>
