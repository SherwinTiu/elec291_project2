  <h1><a name="Preprocessing">Preprocessing</a></h1>
  <hr>

  <p>The translator processes each source file in a series of phases. <b>Preprocessing</b> constitutes the
  earliest phases, which produce a <a href="#translation%20unit">translation unit</a>. Preprocessing treats a
  source file as a sequence of <a href="lib_file.html#text%20lines">text lines</a>. You can specify
  <b><a name="directives">directives</a></b> and <b><a name="macros">macros</a></b> that insert, delete, and
  alter source text.</p>

  <p>This document describes briefly just those aspects of preprocessing most relevant to the use of the
  Standard C library:</p>

  <p>The macro <code><a name="__FILE__">__FILE__</a></code> expands to a <a href=
  "charset.html#string%20literal">string literal</a> that gives the remembered <a href=
  "lib_over.html#filename">filename</a> of the current source file. You can alter the value of this macro by
  writing a <a href="#line%20directive"><i>line</i> directive</a>.</p>

  <p>The macro <code><a name="__LINE__">__LINE__</a></code> expands to a decimal integer constant that gives
  the remembered line number within the current source file. You can alter the value of this macro by writing
  a <a href="#line%20directive"><i>line</i> directive</a>.</p>

  <p>A <b><a name="define directive"><i>define</i> directive</a></b> defines a name as a macro. Following the
  directive name <code>define</code>, you write one of two forms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a name <i>not</i> immediately followed by a left parenthesis, followed by any sequence of
    preprocessing tokens -- to define a macro without parameters</li>

    <li>a name immediately followed by a left parenthesis with <i>no</i> intervening white space, followed by
    zero or more distinct <i>parameter names</i> separated by commas, followed by a right parenthesis,
    followed by any sequence of preprocessing tokens -- to define a macro with as many parameters as names
    that you write inside the parentheses</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can selectively skip groups of lines within source files by writing an <b><a name=
  "if directive"><i>if</i> directive</a></b>, or one of the other <b>conditional directives</b>, <i>ifdef</i>
  or <i>ifndef.</i> You follow the conditional directive by the first group of lines that you want to
  selectively skip. Zero or more <i>elif</i> directives follow this first group of lines, each followed by a
  group of lines that you want to selectively skip. An optional <i>else</i> directive follows all groups of
  lines controlled by <i>elif</i> directives, followed by the last group of lines you want to selectively
  skip. The last group of lines ends with an <i>endif</i> directive.</p>

  <p>At most one group of lines is retained in the translation unit -- the one immediately preceded by a
  directive whose <a href="#if%20expression"><i>#if</i> expression</a> has a nonzero value. For the
  directive:</p>
  <pre>
#ifdef X
</pre>

  <p>this expression is <code>defined (X)</code>, and for the directive:</p>
  <pre>
#ifndef X
</pre>

  <p>this expression is <code>!defined (X)</code>.</p>

  <p>A <b><a name="if expression"><i>#if</i> expression</a></b> is a conditional expression that the
  preprocessor evaluates. You can write only <a href="express.html#integer%20constant%20expression">integer
  constant expressions</a>, with the following additional considerations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The expression <code>defined X</code>, or <code>defined (X)</code>, is replaced by 1 if
    <code>X</code> is defined as a macro, otherwise 0.</li>

    <li>You cannot write the <a href="express.html#sizeof%20operator"><i>sizeof</i></a> or <i>type cast</i>
    operators. (The translator expands all macro names, then replaces each remaining name with 0, before it
    recognizes keywords.)</li>

    <li>The translator may be able to represent a broader range of integers than the target environment.</li>

    <li>The translator represents type <i>int</i> the same as <i>long,</i> and <i>unsigned int</i> the same
    as <i>unsigned long.</i></li>

    <li>The translator can translate character constants to a set of code values different from the set for
    the target environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An <b><a name="include directive"><i>include</i> directive</a></b> includes the contents of a <a href=
  "lib_over.html#standard%20headers">standard header</a> or another source file in a translation unit. The
  contents of the specified standard header or source file replace the <i>include</i> directive. Following
  the directive name <code>include</code>, write one of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a standard header name between angle brackets</li>

    <li>a filename between double quotes</li>

    <li>any other form that expands to one of the two previous forms after macro replacement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <b><a name="line directive"><i>line</i> directive</a></b> alters the source line number and filename
  used by the predefined macros <a href="#__FILE__"><code>__FILE__</code></a> and <a href=
  "#__FILE__"><code>__FILE__</code></a>. Following the directive name <code>line</code>, write one of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a decimal integer (giving the new line number of the line following)</li>

    <li>a decimal integer as before, followed by a string literal (giving the new line number and the new
    source filename)</li>

    <li>any other form that expands to one of the two previous forms after macro replacement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Preprocessing translates each source file in a series of distinct <b><a name=
  "Phases of Translation">phases</a></b>. The first few phases of translation: terminate each line with a
  newline character (<code><i>NL</i></code>), convert trigraphs to their single-character equivalents, and
  concatenate each line ending in a backslash (<code>\</code>) with the line following. Later phases process
  <a href="#include%20directive">include directives</a>, expand macros, and so on to produce a <b><a name=
  "translation unit">translation unit</a></b>. The translator combines separate translation units, with
  contributions as needed from the <a href="index.html#Standard%20C%20Library">Standard C library</a>, at
  <b><a name="link time">link time</a></b>, to form the executable <b><a name="program">program</a></b>.</p>

  <p>An <b><a name="undef directive"><i>undef</i> directive</a></b> removes a macro definition. You might
  want to remove a macro definition so that you can define it differently with a <i>define</i> directive or
  to unmask any other meaning given to the name. The name whose definition you want to remove follows the
  directive name <code>undef</code>. If the name is not currently defined as a macro, the <i>undef</i>
  directive has no effect.</p>
