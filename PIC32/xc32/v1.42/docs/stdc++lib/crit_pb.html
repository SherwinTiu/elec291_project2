  <b>Dinkum C++ Library Reference</b> developed by P.J. Plauger<br>
  <b>Dinkum C Library Reference</b> developed by P.J. Plauger and Jim Brodie<br>
  Additional libraries and documentation developed by Dinkumware, Ltd.</p>

  <p>The Dinkum C++ Library and additional libraries, in machine-readable or printed form (&ldquo;Dinkum
  Library&rdquo;), and the Dinkum C++ Library Reference and additional documentation, in machine-readable or
  printed form (&ldquo;Dinkum Reference&rdquo;), hereafter in whole or in part the &ldquo;Product,&rdquo; are
  all copyrighted by P.J. Plauger and/or Dinkumware, Ltd. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The Product is derived in part
  from books copyright &copy; 1992-2001 by P.J. Plauger.</p>

  <p>Dinkumware, Ltd. and P.J. Plauger (&ldquo;Licensor&rdquo;) retain exclusive ownership of this Product.
  It is licensed to you (&ldquo;Licensee&rdquo;) in accordance with the terms specifically stated in this
  Notice. If you have obtained this Product from a third party or under a special license from Dinkumware,
  Ltd., additional restrictions may also apply. You must otherwise treat the Product the same as other
  copyrighted material, such as a book or recording. You may also exercise certain rights particular to
  computer software under copyright law. In particular:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You may use the Library portion of the Product (if present) to compile and link with C/C++ code to
    produce executable files.</li>

    <li>You may freely distribute such executable files for no additional license fee to Licensor.</li>

    <li>You may make one or more backup copies of the Product for archival purposes.</li>

    <li>You may permanently transfer ownership of the Product to another party only if the other party agrees
    to the terms stated in this Notice and you transfer or destroy all copies of the Product that are in your
    posession.</li>

    <li>You must preserve this Notice and all copyright notices with any copy you make of the Product.</li>

    <li>You may not loan, rent, or sublicense the Product.</li>

    <li>You may not copy or distribute, in any form, any part of this Product for any purpose not
    specifically permitted by this Notice.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This copy of the Product is licensed for use by a limited number of developers, which is specified as
  part of the packaging for this Product. A license for up to ten users, for example, limits to ten the
  number of developers reasonably able to use the Product at any instant of time. Thus, ten is the maximum
  number of <b>possible</b> concurrent users, not the number of <b>actual</b> concurrent users. A single-user
  license is for use by just one developer.</p>

  <p>Anyone who accesses this software has a moral responsibility not to aid or abet illegal copying by
  others. Licensor recognizes that the machine-readable format of the Product makes it particularly conducive
  to sharing within multi-user systems and across networks. Such use is permitted only so long as Licensee
  does not exceed the maximum number of possible concurrent users and takes reasonable precautions to protect
  the Product against unauthorized copying and against public access. In particular, please note that the
  ability to <b>access</b> this copy does not imply permission to <b>use</b> it or to <b>copy</b> it. Please
  note also that Licensor has expended considerable professional effort in the production of this Product,
  and continues to do so to keep it current.</p>

  <p>Licensor warrants that the Product as shipped performs substantially in accordance with its documented
  purpose, and that the medium on which the Product is provided is free from defects in material and
  workmanship. To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties on the Product are limited to 90
  days.</p>

  <p>Licensor's entire liability under this warranty shall be, at Licensor's option, either to refund the
  license fee paid by Licensee or to replace the medium on which the Product is provided. This is also
  Licensee's exclusive remedy. To qualify for this remedy, Licensee must demonstrate satisfactory proof of
  purchase to Licensor and return the Product in reasonably good condition to Licensor.</p>

  <p>LICENSOR OTHERWISE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THIS PRODUCT, EITHER
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE
  AS A RESULT OF USING THIS PRODUCT, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO
  THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.</p>

  <p>By using this Product, you agree to abide by the intellectual property laws and all other applicable
  laws of the USA, and the terms described above. You may be held legally responsible for any infringement
  that is caused or encouraged by your failure to abide by the terms of this Notice.</p>

  <p>RESTRICTED RIGHTS: Use, duplication, or disclosure by the government is subject to the restrictions as
  set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software Clause as DFARS
  52.227-7013 and FAR 52.227-19. Unpublished rights are reserved under the Copyright Laws of the USA.
