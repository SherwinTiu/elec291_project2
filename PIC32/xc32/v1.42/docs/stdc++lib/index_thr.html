  <h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

  <p>A <b><a name="thread">thread</a></b> is a separate flow of execution within an application. On a
  multi-processor system threads can execute simultaneously on different processors. On a single-processor
  system and on a multi-processor system with fewer available processors than active threads two or more
  threads must share a processor. The details of switching a processor from one thread to another are handled
  by the operating system.</p>

  <p>The Dinkum Threads Library lets you create and control multiple threads, and synchronize the sharing of
  data between these threads. It consists of compatible and complementary interfaces for programming in
  either C or C++. The <a href="cthrd_over.html">C Interface</a> is very similar to the thread support
  interface defined in the the <a href="http://www.unix-systems.org/version3/ieee_std.html">Posix</a>
  Standard (also known as <b><a name="pthreads">pthreads</a></b>), while the <a href="cppthrd_over.html">C++
  Interface</a> is very similar to the <b><a href=
  "http://www.boost.org/libs/thread/doc/index.html">boost.threads</a></b> library for C++.</p>

  <p>When a C or C++ program begins execution it runs in a single thread, executing the <code>main</code>
  function. The program can create additional threads as needed. Each thread has its own copy of all
  <code>auto</code> variables, so <code>auto</code> values in one thread are independent of <code>auto</code>
  values in the other threads. Data with static storage duration is accessible to all threads, so those
  values are shared. However, changes to values in shared data often are not immediately visible in other
  threads. A multi-threaded application uses condition variables, mutexes, and once functions to coordinate
  the use of shared data by its threads, in order to ensure that shared data is not made inconsistent by
  simultaneous changes from more than one thread, that changes to shared data are visible to a thread when
  needed, and that a thread that needs data that is being created by another thread can be notified when that
  data becomes available.</p>

  <h2><a name="Memory Visibility">Memory Visibility</a></h2>

  <p>Changes made by one thread to values in shared data often are not immediately <b><a name=
  "visible">visible</a></b> in other threads. For example, on a system with two separate processors and two
  threads running on the two processors, if the two processors simply share main memory an attempt by one
  processor to write data while the other processor reads the same data could result in the second processor
  reading a data value that has only been partially changed by the other processor. In order to avoid this
  inconsistency one processor has to lock the other one out until it finishes. This locking is usually done
  through the hardware and is known as a <i>bus lock</i>. Bus locks are unavoidable, but they slow the
  processors down. To minimize the effect of this slowdown, multi-processor systems have separate cache
  memory for each processor. This cache memory holds a copy of some of the data in main memory. When a
  processor writes data it writes to the cache. Sometime later the changes made to the cache are written to
  main memory. Thus, the processors could each have a different value for a data item in their caches, and
  those values could be different from the value in main memory.</p>

  <p>There are three times at which changes made to memory by one thread are guaranteed to be visible in
  another thread:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>when a thread is created, changes to memory made by the creating thread prior to creating the new
    thread are visible to the new thread</li>

    <li>when a thread locks a mutex, changes made by other threads prior to unlocking the same mutex are
    visible to the locking thread</li>

    <li>when a thread joins another thread, changes made by the joined thread prior to exiting are visible to
    the joining thread</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In practice this means that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>constant data that is initialized before a thread starts can be accessed in the thread without
    further precautions</li>

    <li>modifiable data should be accessed only from code controlled by a mutex, both in threads that modify
    the data and in threads that use the data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note, however, that locking a mutex to prevent modification of shared data while it is being read also
  prevents other threads from locking the mutex in order to read the data. Such critical sections should be
  kept as short as possible to avoid blocking other threads any longer than necessary.</p>

  <h2><a name="Condition Variables">Condition Variables</a></h2>

  <p>A <b><a name="condition variable">condition variable</a></b> is used by a thread to wait until another
  thread notifies it that a condition has become true. Code that waits for a condition variable must also use
  a <a href="#mutex">mutex</a>; before calling any of the functions that wait for the condition variable the
  calling thread must lock the mutex, and when the called function returns the mutex will be locked. During
  the time that a thread is blocked waiting for the condition to become true the mutex is not locked.</p>

  <p><b><a name="spurious wakeups">Spurious wakeups</a></b> occur when threads waiting for condition
  variables become unblocked without appropriate notifications. Code that waits for a condition to become
  true should explicitly check that condition when returning from a wait function to recognize such spurious
  wakeups. This is usually done with a loop:</p>
  <pre>
while (condition is false)
    wait for condition variable;
</pre>

  <p>The condition variable functions use a mutex internally; when a thread returns from a wait function any
  changes made to memory by threads that called a wait function or a notify function before the return will
  be <a href="#visible">visible</a> to the caller.</p>

  <h2><a name="Mutexes">Mutexes</a></h2>

  <p>A <b><a name="mutex">mutex</a></b> is used to insure that only one thread executes a region of code,
  known as a critical section, at any one time. On entry into the critical section the code locks the mutex;
  if no other thread holds the mutex the lock operation succeeds and the calling thread holds the mutex. On
  exit from the critical section the code unlocks the mutex. If another thread holds the mutex when a thread
  tries to lock it the thread that tried to lock the mutex blocks until the mutex is unlocked. When more than
  one thread is blocked waiting for the mutex an unlock releases one of the blocked threads.</p>

  <p>A mutex can be <b><a name="recursive">recursive</a></b> or <b><a name=
  "non-recursive">non-recursive</a></b>. When a thread that already holds a recursive mutex attempts to lock
  it again the thread does not block. The thread must unlock the mutex as many times as it locked it before
  any other thread will be permitted to lock the mutex. When a thread that already holds a non-recursive
  mutex attempts to lock it again the thread will block. Since the thread cannot then unlock the mutex, the
  result is a deadlock. Non-recursive mutexes are usually smaller and faster than recursive mutexes, so a
  properly written program that uses non-recursive mutexes can be faster than one that uses recursive
  mutexes.</p>

  <p>A mutex supports <b><a name="test and return">test and return</a></b> if it provides a lock call that
  does not block if the mutex is already locked. Such a lock call returns a value that indicates whether the
  mutex was locked as a result of the call.</p>

  <p>A mutex supports <b><a name="timeout">timeout</a></b> if it provides a lock call that blocks until no
  later than a specified time waiting for the mutex to be unlocked. Such a lock call returns a value that
  indicates whether the mutex was locked as a result of the call.</p>

  <h2><a name="Once Functions">Once Functions</a></h2>

  <p>A <b><a name="once function">once function</a></b> is a function that should only be called once during
  a program's execution. Once functions are typically used to initialize data that is shared between threads:
  the first thread that needs the data initializes it by calling the once function, and later threads that
  need the data do not call the once function. Each once function should have an associated once flag,
  statically initialized to indicate that the function has not been called. Code that needs to insure that
  the once function has been called calls <code>call_once</code>, passing the flag and the address of the
  once function. The code in <code>call_once</code> atomically checks the flag, and if the flag indicates
  that the function has not been called, calls the once function and sets the flag to indicate that the
  function has been called.</p>

  <p>The function <code>call_once</code> uses a mutex internally; when it returns any changes made to memory
  by the once function will be <a href="#visible">visible</a> to the caller.</p>

  <h2><a name="Thread-specific Storage">Thread-specific Storage</a></h2>

  <p>Thread-specific storage is global data that can hold a distinct value for each thread that uses it. This
  permits functions executing in a single thread to share data without interfering with the data shared by
  the same functions when executing in other threads.</p>

  <h2><a name="Checked and Unchecked Libraries">Checked and Unchecked Libraries</a></h2>

  <p>The library can be built as a checked version and as an unchecked version. The checked version uses a
  macro similar to C's <code>assert</code> macro to test the conditions marked as <b><i><a name=
  "Precondition">Precondition</a></i></b>s in the functional descriptions. Conditions marked <b><i><a name=
  "Requires">Requires</a></i></b> may or may not be tested. When a failure is detected the macro writes an
  error message to standard out and calls the function <a href=
  "threads.html#thrd_abort"><code>thrd_abort</code></a>. For runtime debugging, set a breakpoint on that
  function.</p>

  <p>To use the checked version, define either the macro <code>THREAD_CHECK</code> or the macro
  <code>_DEBUG</code> to a non-zero numeric value in all code that uses the library, and link to the checked
  version of the library. To use the unchecked version, do not define either of those macros in any code that
  uses the library, and link to the unchecked version of the library. See the <b>README</b> file that came
  with your copy of the library for details on how to link to the appropriate version of the library.</p>
